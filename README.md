This repository contains a utility tool for Unity developers, which works on top of the [Gesture Samples](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.hands@1.4/manual/index.html#samples).
The tool facilitates the capturing of Unity's XRHandShape, enabling developers to create snapshots easily. These snapshots can then be exported as assets for convenient reuse within the Unity engine.

1. Start the recording scene under `SimpleGestureRecorder/Scenes/Recording Scene.unity`.
   
2. To create a handshape, begin the recording by making a thumb pose with both hands.
   
3. Hold this pose until a countdown timer appears.
   
4. Aim your hands within the frame.
   
5. After the timer reaches 0, the recording starts.
    
6. Make your custom pose and hold it until the recording stops.
    
7. Test your pose in the scene; if everything works, the indicators will light up.
    
8. Assets were created under `SimpleGestureRecorder/Snapshots`:
   - Screenshot of Pose
   - (optional) LeftHandPose
   - (optional) RightHandPose
